\\======================================//

Apologies for the fancy box.

Evaluates Postfix Arithmetic expressions.

Contains:
	PostFixUtil: driver class. creates a new EvaluationFrame.

	EvaluationFrame: GUI class. constructs GUI which runs the Evaluator class.

	Evaluator: Contains method for the evaluation of a postfix expression. (3/2/14: Works only on integers)

	Stack: An implementation of the data structure known as a Stack. Based off of the Stack<T> class in Dr. Sesh Venugopal's "Data Structures Outside In with Java" textbook. Modifications include the use of an ArrayList instead of a LinkedList, and the creation of a peek() method as opposed to the next() method in the book.

	IllegalExpressionException: empty exception class.

	Version 1.0: Bare bones visual, works only on integers.
